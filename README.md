# Triangulation [Port](https://github.com/iShape-Swift/iShapeTriangulation/)
Complex polygon triangulation, tessellation and split into convex polygons. A fast O(n*log(n)) algorithm based on "Triangulation of monotone polygons". The result can be represented as a Delaunay triangulation.

## Features

ðŸ’¡ Fast O(n*log(n)) algorithm based on "Triangulation of monotone polygons"

ðŸ’¡ All code is written to suit "Data Oriented Design". No reference type like class, just structs.

ðŸ’¡ Supports polygons with holes

ðŸ’¡ Supports plain and Delaunay triangulation

ðŸ’¡ Supports tesselation

ðŸ’¡ Supports building centroid net

ðŸ’¡ Same points is not restricted

ðŸ’¡ Polygon must not have self intersections

ðŸ’¡ Use integer geometry for calculations

ðŸ’¡ More then 100 tests
